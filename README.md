## About
This is the repository for the Decent Apps landing page.

Decent Apps is a suite of web applications I built. Some of them are dApps with a focus on privacy, security, and decentralization. For example, the C# Online Compiler runs entirely in your browser using WebAssembly, ensuring your code never leaves your device. Additionally, it uses Gun.js(decentralized database) for storage and live sharing of the code editor.

All the applications are Blazor WebAssembly PWA(progressive web apps) that you can download/install so you can use them offline.
